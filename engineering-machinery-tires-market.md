<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engineering Machinery Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The engineering machinery tires market comprises two primary types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires feature layers of fabric, arranged at angles, providing durability and flexibility, making them suitable for rough terrains. However, they tend to generate more heat and offer less stability at high speeds. In contrast, radial tires have steel belts running perpendicular to the tread, enhancing strength, fuel efficiency, and traction. This design allows for better handling and longevity, making radial tires increasingly popular in modern machinery.</p></p>
