<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stormwater Retention & Detention System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stormwater Retention System</li><li>Stormwater Detention System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stormwater retention and detention systems are crucial for managing runoff in urban environments. A stormwater retention system is designed to hold back water, allowing it to infiltrate the ground naturally, thus improving water quality and reducing flooding risks. In contrast, a stormwater detention system temporarily stores excess runoff during storms and releases it slowly, mitigating peak flow rates to prevent downstream flooding. Both systems are vital for sustainable urban development, ensuring effective stormwater management and environmental protection.</p></p>
